<p style="font-align:left;">Your health care worker uses your child's measurements such as height/length, weight and head circumference(under 2) to ensure that he/she is growing in an appropriate manner. It is one of the signs of good general health and is used as a health screening tool.
</p>
<p>You can also use these growth measurements, regardless of where it is obtained, to keep track of their numbers and even obtain their percentiles at different points over time.</p>
<p>The information can be used for your own personal information and/or to share with your health care team.</p>
<p>This program uses the data from the World Health Organization Growth standards and references and plots it on the set 2 WHO growth curves. For more information on growth curves and measurements see whogrowthcharts.ca</p>
